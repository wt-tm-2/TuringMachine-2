                README file for the Turing Machine 2 project

PACKAGE OVERVIEW:

You should be reading this file in a directory called TuringMachine2.
There should be a file called `turingMachineFX.jar' which can be executed
to run the latest build of our Turing machine project.

    $ java -jar turingMachineFX.jar

There should also be a subdirectory called `turingMachineFX'. This directory
contains a NetBeans project. 

Some example programs exist in `turingMachineFX/testProgs-Data/'.

DOCUMENTATION:

The Javadoc for this project exists in `turingMachineFX/dist/javadoc'.

DEPENDENCIES:

Our project only relies on JavaFX for the GUI. Everything else uses base
Java 8.

BUILDING OR EDITING:

To build or edit this project in NetBeans, simply import the 
`turingMachineFX' directory as a NetBeans project. If you wish to use
another Java IDE or edit the source code from a text editor, all the
source files can be extracted from the `turingmachineFX/src' directory.

SOURCE OVERVIEW:

The Java source code for this project is organized into the following
packages:

  * Controller      Contains the class TMController which acts as the
                    interpreter for the simulator.

  * Parser          Contains the parser module which is a collection
                    of classes used to read a Turing machine source
                    file into a Java HashMap. This is used throughout
                    the project.

  * Resources       Contains some HTML files. One is used to display
                    the loaded Turing machine source code. The other
                    contains some documentation that can be accessed
                    while the application is running from menu bar.

  * StateDiagram    Contains the state diagram module which is a class
                    that builds and displays a visual representation
                    of the Turing machine source that is loaded.

  * TuringMachineFX Contains the GUI module. A collection of classes
                    and FXML files that define the structure and behavior
                    of the application's user interface.

FINAL NOTES:

We recommend using SceneBuilder to edit the JavaFX FXML files that define
the user interface. SceneBuilder provides a drag-and-drop interface to
build the GUI visually.
