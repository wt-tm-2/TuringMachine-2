The following are syntax specifications that the parser expects from the input
Turing Machine source file.

1. A line in the input file can be blank, a comment line, or contain
   a Turing Machine state transition.

2. The comment character is '#'. Any lines starting with this character or
   whitespace followed by this character are ignored by the parser.

3. A valid Turing Machine state transition is a 5-tuple in the form:

    (<current state>, <read symbol> <write symbol>, <direction>, <new state>)

4. The <current state> and <new state> can contain any alphanumeric 
   character and _. There is no restriction on length at this time. The
   mnemonics could be a single digit like '0' or a more descriptive name
   like "carry_state".

5. The read and write symbols can be any single printable ASCII character
   except the comment character '#'.

6. The direction token can be 'l' or 'L' for a left movement of the read/write
   head, 'r' or 'R' for a right movement, or 'n' or 'N' for no movement.
