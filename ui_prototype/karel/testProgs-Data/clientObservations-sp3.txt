Client Observations:
    File handling:
        You do remember file location after first file open (of source or
        world)

    Screen Redraw (robot movement) -- seems slow even at 1000%

    Behavior for second click on a wall segment:
        works only if the wall was defined in all upper-case -- correct such
        that your processing is case indifferent.  Also when creating wall or
        beeper spec, do so in lower case

    Behavior for right-click on a beeper stack:
        Same problem here as with the wall sections -- processing should be 
        case indifferent

    Orientation of robot, beepers and wall segments appears OK through
        testing so far conducted

    Control panel location and behavior seems OK through testing so far
        conducted

Your summary was adequate.  I assumed your work for my review was in
branch master.
